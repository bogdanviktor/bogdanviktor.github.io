Yojee understands that everybody likes to make some extra cash and to work on their own terms so we do not impose minimum work hours or number of jobs. We believe everybody should be able to control their own time and income so you choose when you want to work and for how long.  The only requests we make are that you respect Yojee’s <a href="#sle">Service Level Expectations</a>.

<h4 id="sle">What are Yojee’s Service Level Expectations?</h4>
To ensure that everybody has a great experience with Yojee, we ask that our Delivery Partners adhere to Yojee’s Service Level Expectations.  The main request we make is that if you encounter any issues, you contact the Yojee Operations Team first at +65 3195 1335!

<h2 class="nunito_bold" style="margin:100px 0px 50px 0px;text-align: center">Delivering for Yojee as a Delivery Partner – FAQs</h2>
<h4>How do I contact Yojee’s Operations team?</h4>
For non-urgent operational support, you can contact us, via email <a href="mailto:partner@sendyojee.com">partner@sendyojee.com</a> or by using the in-app chat system.  For urgent support, call +65 3195 1335.
<br><br>

<h4>How do I receive training for Yojee’s Driver App?</h4>
Training for the Driver App will be given during your Delivery Partner training session.
<br><br>

<h4>I’m registered and I’ve received the requisite training.  How do I start delivering for Yojee?</h4>
Once you are a Yojee Partner Driver you can start delivering immediately! When you are logged into your Driver App and the app shows your status as “On Duty”,  jobs will automatically be assigned to you.  Please do take note of Yojee’s <a href="#sle">Service Level Expectations</a>.
<br><br>

<h4>What happens if I lose or damage a parcel?</h4>
If you lose or damage a parcel, please inform Yojee’s Operations team immediately via the in-app chat or on +65 3159 1335.  Do not contact the customer.  Yojee will assess the extent of the damage or cost of the lost item and follow-up with the customer.
<br><br>

<h4>May I change pick-up and delivery times with the customer?</h4>
Please do not make any timing changes with customers.  Should you need to make changes, contact Yojee’s Operations team using the in-app chat or  on +65 3159 1335.  The team will assess the situation and contact the customer on your behalf.
<br><br>

<h4>I was assigned a job but now I cannot complete the delivery. What do I do?</h4>
When your status is shown as “On Duty” it will be assumed that you are available for jobs and jobs will be automatically assigned to you.  If an unforeseen circumstance arises and you think you may be delayed or unable to complete a job, please “Reject” the job and it will be reassigned to another Delivery Partner.   Do note that Yojee’s Operations team will monitor all job rejections and may contact you to discuss.
<br><br>

<h4>Can I cancel the delivery after it has been assigned to me?</h4>
A job can be rejected but note that as part of our <a href="#sle">Service Level Expectations</a>, Yojee will monitor all rejections and may contact you to discuss. If an unforeseen circumstance arises and you think you may be delayed or unable to complete a job, please contact Yojee’s Operations team immediately and they will instruct you on next steps to take.
<br><br>

<h4>For a three hour delivery, when does the timer start?</h4>
The three-hour countdown starts from the moment a job is confirmed by the customer (sender). For example, if a delivery request is booked and confirmed at 1pm, the parcel must be delivered by 4pm.
<br><br>

<h4>Why must I allow GPS tracking on my phone?</h4>
Yojee offers real-time tracking of parcels as well as a live countdown to pick-up and delivery times.  GPS tracking allows Yojee to provide this information to our users, so GPS tracking must be turned on whilst you are delivering for Yojee.
<br><br>

<h4>What are Yojee’s operating hours?</h4>
Yojee delivers between 10am – 10pm, Monday through Saturday, so you will have access to jobs for delivery within that time frame.  Yojee’s Operations team will be available to support you during those times.  For now, Yojee will not deliver parcels on Sundays and public holidays, during which time our Operations team will also have a rest!
<br><br>

<h4>What happens if the sender / receiver is not there to hand over / receive their parcel?</h4>
This should be rare as Yojee’s app provides both senders and receivers with up-to-the-minute countdowns of pickup/delivery times. In the event that the sender / recipient is not there, please contact them first. If you are unable to make contact, please inform the Yojee Operations team immediately, safe-guard the parcel (if already picked up) and move on to the next delivery job while awaiting further instructions from Yojee’s Operations team.
<br><br>

<h4>Am I allowed to leave parcels at a destination if a recipient is not there?</h4>
If the recipient is not available to receive a parcel, do not leave the parcel at its destination.  You are only allowed to leave parcels outside a delivery location, i.e. complete a job with no proof-of-delivery (POD) signature, if there is explicit written consent from a customer authorising this.  Once you have received written consent, please inform Yojee operations team and provide a copy of the written consent, e.g. screenshot.  Otherwise, a POD signature is required to complete deliveries.
<br><br>

<h4>Am I allowed to complete a delivery whilst my status is “Off Duty”?</h4>
If you turn your status to “Off Duty” during a job you will be able to complete the delivery but as long as your status remains “Off Duty” you will not receive any new jobs.
