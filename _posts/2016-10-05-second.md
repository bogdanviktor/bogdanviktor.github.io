Yojee’s developers have been toiling away to get our platform ready for launch. Our Phase 1 is concentrated on the last-mile delivery section of the supply chain and we are thrilled to have kicked off Last-Mile Delivery Pilot Programmes in both Singapore and Melbourne!  

Each pilot company has a different delivery model which demonstrates how Yojee’s platform can benefit users across the entire last-mile delivery spectrum. We’re proud to have a well-established logistics provider, SH Roadworks, and an innovative food delivery platform, DishDash, piloting for us in Singapore. In Australia, Melbourne’s first independent bike courier, Cargone, is Yojee’s pilot partner.

### **Feature Innovation**  

We’re excited to showcase three cracking features of our new platform.

### **Yojee + YOU**  

##### How technological innovation is solving problems for Logistics Service Providers  

The explosive growth of e-commerce in SE Asia and Australia means that convenient, ‘on-demand’ delivery services are fast becoming the norm rather than being a ‘value-add’ service as in the past. The rapid pace of innovation coupled with tightening of last-mile delivery windows forces logistics service providers to be nimble in order to successfully execute deliveries without compromising their customer experience. How do service providers deal with this challenge? Capgemini’s 20thAnnual 3PL Logistics Study found that a triad combination of processes should be implemented:  

1. Real-time electronic tracking & communication
2. Route optimisation
3. Incentivised scheduling  

These challenges are not confined to 3PLs: they present themselves to every service provider along the supply chain.  

In this edition we explore the first two processes and demonstrate how Yojee is providing solutions.  

With Yojee comes unprecedented visibility, and quicker responsiveness and deployment coupled with access to an unprecedented ‘shared logistics network’ – all essential in fulfilling ‘on-demand’ services.  

###### **Real-time Electronic Tracking & Communication**  

Transparent and effective communication between service providers and shippers are cited as factors that impact the ability of both parties to be sufficiently agile and flexible. The Capgemini study showed that real-time alignment between parties facilitates operational and strategic consistency.  In practice this means an automated system for both parties to see up-to-the-minute status reports on activities and routes. As more investment is poured into cloud-based solutions and the use of smartphones becomes more prevalent, dissemination of key ‘live’ information coupled with real-time communication within a secure, closed platform has high potential.  

**How Yojee solves for Real-Time Tracking & Communication**  

Yojee's platform offers real-time chats, reporting & tracking for logistics managers and drivers. These channels are contained within Yojee's simple-to-use yet tightly secured applications. The channels enable users to manage and monitor jobs and processes live. Furthermore, all communication and tracking data is archived, providing full job and chat history for analysis and performance monitoring.  

###### **Route Optimisation**  

In order to meet customer requirements whilst preserving margin, service providers are turning to technology to find the most profitable and efficient routes and to reduce ‘empty miles’. Customers’ networks and demands can change at the last minute which static routing is unable to account for. Smart, machine-learning technology, however, applies dynamic routing, i.e. real-time alterations to routing and driver-assignments, in order to maximize the efficiency of freight movement whilst reducing costs.  

**How Yojee solves for Route Optimisation**  

Yojee's platform might be simple to use but incredible intelligence is hidden within our software. This intelligence is powerful enough to optimise freight movement, resulting in service providers becoming both more efficient and profitable whilst reducing their fuel bills and carbon footprints.
